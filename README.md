# Cursor plugins for all harnesses

Fork of [cursor/plugins](https://github.com/cursor/plugins). Plugin logic is unchanged. This fork adds marketplace manifests so the same catalog can be added to Claude Code, Codex, GitHub Copilot CLI, and Grok Build.

## Add the marketplace

```sh
claude plugin marketplace add rudironsoni/cursor-plugins-for-all-harnesses
codex plugin marketplace add rudironsoni/cursor-plugins-for-all-harnesses
copilot plugin marketplace add rudironsoni/cursor-plugins-for-all-harnesses
grok plugin marketplace add rudironsoni/cursor-plugins-for-all-harnesses
```

Then install one plugin. Example:

```sh
claude plugin install cursor-team-kit@cursor-plugins-for-all-harnesses
```

`.cursor-plugin/marketplace.json` is the Cursor catalog. The other catalogs are hand-maintained JSON next to it. See [scripts/sync-upstream.md](scripts/sync-upstream.md).

Official Cursor plugins for popular developer tools, frameworks, and SaaS products. Each plugin is a standalone directory at the repository root with its own `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` manifest.

## Repository structure

This is a multi-plugin marketplace repository. The root `.cursor-plugin/marketplace.json` lists all plugins. Generated catalogs live next to it:

```
.
├── .cursor-plugin/marketplace.json      # Source of truth (Cursor)
├── .claude-plugin/marketplace.json      # Claude Code
├── .agents/plugins/marketplace.json     # Codex / ChatGPT
├── .github/plugin/marketplace.json      # GitHub Copilot CLI
├── .grok-plugin/marketplace.json        # Grok Build
├── plugin-name/
│   ├── .cursor-plugin/plugin.json

│   ├── mcp.json
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── CHANGELOG.md
│   └── LICENSE
└── ...
```

Cursor-only `rules/` files stay in the plugin dirs. Other harnesses do not load them.

`continual-learning` and `ralph-loop` ship Cursor hook event names (`stop`, `afterAgentResponse`). Claude Code validation rejects those keys. Skills in those plugins still install. The hooks themselves stay Cursor-shaped on purpose.
