# Cursor plugins

Fork of [cursor/plugins](https://github.com/cursor/plugins). Each plugin folder is installable on Claude Code, Grok, Codex, and OpenCode. Skill and MCP files stay where they are.

```sh
claude plugin marketplace add rudironsoni/cursor-plugins-for-all-harnesses
claude plugin install teaching@cursor-plugins

grok plugin marketplace add rudironsoni/cursor-plugins-for-all-harnesses
grok plugin install teaching --trust

codex plugin marketplace add rudironsoni/cursor-plugins-for-all-harnesses
codex plugin install teaching
```

OpenCode has no marketplace. Every plugin ships an `opencode.js`. After you have the plugin folder, add it in `opencode.json`:

```json
{ "plugin": ["./teaching/opencode.js"] }
```

MCP plugins (everything under `third_party/`) register their server via the `config` hook, so there is nothing else to configure. Restart OpenCode after enabling, because MCP registration happens at startup. Credentials use `{env:VAR}` interpolation, for example `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` for `third_party/github`. Services that use OAuth client credentials (`docusign`, `gong`, `hubspot`, `salesforce`, `x`, `x-ads`, `zoom`) register an `oauth` block; run `opencode mcp auth <server>` to complete the flow.

Skill plugins (the first-party folders such as `teaching/`, plus `advisor`) keep their skills in `./skills/`. Copy or symlink them into `.opencode/skills`, `.claude/skills`, or `.agents/skills` for discovery.

Or use the community installer, which reads this repo's Claude catalog:

```sh
npx opencode-market add rudironsoni/cursor-plugins-for-all-harnesses
npx opencode-market install teaching@cursor-plugins --opencode
```


Official Cursor plugins for popular developer tools, frameworks, and SaaS products. Each plugin is a standalone directory at the repository root with its own `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` manifest.
